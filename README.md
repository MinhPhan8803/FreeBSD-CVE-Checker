# FreeBSD CVE Checker

## Introduction

This is a CVE checker written in Rust. It uses FreeBSD's maintained vulnerability database `/var/db/pkg/vuln.xml` to look for vulnerabilities, then compare them against the list of installed packages `/var/db/pkg/local.sqlite`

## Todo

- [X] Support the case of M packages to N version ranges.
- [X] Differentiate le/lt and ge/gt
- [X] Store vulnerable package data in relational DB.

## Ongoing
- [ ] Conduct further testing
- [ ] Improve performance
